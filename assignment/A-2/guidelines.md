Guidelines For Assignment 2 (Please read carefully):
	Both parts of the assignment are available as A-2/a2p1_v0.1.py and A-2/a2p2_v0.1.py. More instructions on how to submit the assignment will follow as minor updates.
	Each team will be creating a conda environment for one of the users. You might need to edit files inside the installed packages in your conda environment. Please create only one environment per team to avoid bloat on the disk. If we notice, more than one environment for a team, we will randomly disable one member's account for the team. Steps to create a conda env:
	Login to the head node of the Turing cluster using your SSH credentials.
	Run the command /apps/conda_setup.sh
	Follow the prompts and an environment should be created as your username at /mnt/data/miniconda3/envs with basic packages like torch, deepspeed, numpy, transformers and datasets.
	All jobs must be submitted via Slurm. Once again, if we get to know that a job is running without slurm, you may be penalized. 
	Each team has been allocated 4 hour slots with a total of 4 GPUs. The slots are assigned randomly and cannot be changed. You can only submit jobs within your slot. Your job will be terminated if it exceeds the slot duration, so keep checkpoints that you can resume from. If  the srun command duration ( -t flag) exceeds your slot limits, the job may not start.
	You can check whether your slot is active right now or when it will be active next using the command /apps/myslot.sh. Rule of thumb: if the current active slot shows as team04_20260404_0000, this means currently the slot belongs to Team 4 and it started at 00:00 and will end at 04:00.
	The preprocessing part of the assignment must  be run using N=1 and num_gpus=1. If you do not follow this, you might end up with corrupt data outputs.
	The training part of the assignment can be run using 1-4 GPUs. More instructions in the python script.

PLEASE TRY TO FINISH THE SETUP AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND LET US KNOW IF YOU ARE FACING ANY ISSUES. THE CONDA SETUP CAN BE DONE OUTSIDE YOUR SLOT.
Slots were created randomly using the script /apps/generate_reservations.py (slots will start from 4th April 00:00)

Clarification regarding test dataset. You do not need to tokenize the test dataset. Use it as is. 
The test set is standardized so that you can evaluate your models uniformly on the same inputs. You can just ignore the instruction to convert and save the test set. 
 
Note: This announcement is to clarify that only the instructions will change. The template will remain largely unchanged, so please proceed without waiting.
